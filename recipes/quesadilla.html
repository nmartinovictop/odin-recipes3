    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>A cheese quesadilla is a very common and easy dish that takes only a few minutes and can be done with three ingredients.  It's a favorite of college students or anyone that needs a quick meal that is tasty.</p>

    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Butter, about a tablespoon</li>
        <li>A large tortilla, flour is preferred for this</li>
        <li>Cheddar cheese</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat a frying pan on medium heat.  You will need a frying pan that is large enough to take the whole tortilla if it is laid down in the pan.</li>
        <li>Once the pan is hot, add the butter to the pan and let it melt</li>
        <li>Add the tortilla to the pan, laying it flat.</li>
        <li>Add cheese to the flattened quesadilla.  You should put enough cheese that all parts of the quesadilla are covered, but you don't need to put so much that you can't see the tortilla through the cheese.</li>
        <li>Once the cheese has melted, fold the tortilla onto itself to create a half circle.</li>
        <li>Let the tortilla continue to fry. When the bottom is a nice golde brown, flip the tortilla</li>
        <li>Once the final side is a nice golden brown, take the tortilla off the heat.</li>
        <li>Allow the quesadilla to cool for a few minutes before biting in.  Enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
