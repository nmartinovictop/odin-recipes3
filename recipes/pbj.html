        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>A peanut butter and jelly sandwich is a very traditional American sandwich.  It's been enjoyed by everyone, from kids at school to adults at work.  Hard to beat the savory and sweet flavors.</p>

        <h4>Ingredients</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Two slices of bread.  Any bread will work, but typically white or wheat bread is preferred</li>
            <li>Peanut butter, enough to cover a one side of a slice of bread.  Either smooth or chunky will work.</li>
            <li>Jelly, enough to cover another slice of bread.  There's no traditional type of jelly used and people have strong opinions.  Grape, Blueberry, and Strawberry Jellies are common.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Steps</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Take a slice of bread</li>
            <li>On one side, spread the peanut butter so it covers the bread evenly</li>
            <li>Take the other slice of bread</li>
            <li>Add jelly to one side of the bread, enough that it covers the bread</li>
            <li>Put the slices of bread together so that peanut butter and jelly are touching</li>
            <li>Enjoy!</li>
        </ol>
